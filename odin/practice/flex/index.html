FOR FLEX SHRINK 
it all depends upon the shrinking rate of the previous flex items in the element
for example
contianer width is 300
if I say

/* this selector selects all divs inside of .flex-container */
.flex-container div {
  background: peachpuff;
  border: 4px solid brown;
  height: 100px;
  width: 250px;
  flex: 1 1 auto;
}
it will look like this:-
[  ][  ][  ]

flex: 1 1 auto;
to all the 3 div elements of the container
the output will be  
3 div boxes in 1 row arranged equally to the space they given even though if the width of each 
flexitem is 250 it will adjust it width to fit all 3 boxes equally in the 300 width flex box container

and now 
if i add:- 
flex: 1 1 auto
to all the div boxes
and suppose the 2nd div box is with class name two
so if i add 

flexcontainer .two{
    flex-shrink:0;
}
it will look like :- 
[ ][    ][ ] 

taking 300px of space

now the shrinking of flex box 2 is set to 0 so it will not shrink it/would not adjust its width for other boxes it will remain 250px 
because it is relative to the one of flex: 1 "1" auto; which was applied to all the div
even if we adjust the height/width of our browser it will not change

so if 
another case is 
.flex-container div {
    background: peachpuff;
    border: 4px solid brown;
    height: 100px;
    width: 250px;
    flex: 1 1 auto;
  }
  
  .flex-container .two {
    flex-shrink: 2;
  }

now second container will shrink twice more then other 2 container 
as the property of shrinking is twice then the other 2 container so it will be like:-
[    ][  ][    ]

if i do 
.flex-container div {
    background: peachpuff;
    border: 4px solid brown;
    height: 100px;
    width: 250px;
    flex: 1 2 auto;
  }
  
  .flex-container .two {
    flex-shrink: 2;
  }

it will look like :- 
[  ][  ][  ]
no element will shrink as shrinking rate is set to 2 for all the 3 divs for the space which is given


FOR FLEX GROW
.flex-container {
    display: flex;
  }
  
  /* this selector selects all divs inside of .flex-container */
  .flex-container div {
    background: peachpuff;
    border: 4px solid brown;
    height: 100px;
    flex: 1 1 0%;
  }
  
  /* only div.two is selected here */
  .flex-container .two {
    flex: 2 1 0%;
  }

no auto is used 
rest is all the same 








USE OF FLEX Basis and AUTO in the flex shrink example :-

flex-basis simply sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size. The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis: 0%. The reason we had to change it to auto in the flex-shrink example is that with the basis set to 0, those items would ignore the items width, and everything would shrink evenly. Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item to check for a width declaration (width: 250px).
